HLL-Expression-Grammar
==================

Simple, minimalist  grammar/actions roles for defining high-level language expressions, notably:

- terms & values
- `prefix`, `infix`, `postfix` and `circumfix` operators.
- precedence rules

Under construction. For an example, please see `t/01-sample-calculator.t`.
